The `ghost install` command is your one-stop-shop to get a running production install of Ghost.

This command includes the necessary mysql, nginx and systemd configuration to get your publication online, and provides a series of setup questions to configure your new publication. The end result is a fully installed and configured instance âœ¨

> Not ready for production yet? `ghost install local` installs ghost in development mode using sqlite3 and a local process manager. Read more about [local installs](/install/local/). 


## How it works

The `ghost install` command runs a nested command structure, but you only ever have to enter a single command. 

First, it will run `ghost doctor` to check your environment is compatible. If checks pass, a local folder is setup, and Ghost is then downloaded from npm and installed.

Next, `ghost setup` runs, which will provide [prompts](/install/ubuntu/#install-questions) for you to configure your new publication, including creating a MySQL user, initialising a database, configure nginx and sets up SSL. 

As the install process runs, you'll be prompted to confirm certain steps or provide information. Here's a run down of what happens:

Finally, the CLI will prompt to see if you want to run Ghost and if you choose yes `ghost start` will run. 

Ta-da ðŸŽ‰ a single command has successfully installed Ghost. To read more about the full install process for production check out the [setup guide](/install/ubuntu/).
